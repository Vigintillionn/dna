# Datastrucures and Algorithms
This repo contains the code used for my tasks for a class I'm taking, datastructures and algorithms. It is used to plot the amount of comparissons between specific algorithms.

## Overview of algorithms and their cases
|           | Best Case             | Average Case          | Worst Case            | In Place   |
| --------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Selection | $\sim \dfrac{n^2}{2}$ | $\sim \dfrac{n^2}{2}$ | $\sim \dfrac{n^2}{2}$ | \checkmark | 
| Insertion | $\sim n$              | $\sim \dfrac{n^2}{4}$ | $\sim \dfrac{n^2}{2}$ | \checkmark |
